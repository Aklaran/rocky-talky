Beneath the frost-kissed peaks, I stand in awe,
The glaciers gleam, a frozen, sculptured thaw.
The ridgelines rise, like ancient, weathered teeth,
Cutting the sky, in majestic, jagged sheath.

The path winds on, through meadows, wild and free,
Where wildflowers dance, 'neath birdsong's symphony.
But soon the trail turns steep, the air grows thin,
As I ascend, this arduous climb begin.

The rocky scree shifts 'neath my weary feet,
The wind howls 'round, a tempest's icy beat.
Yet onward still, I push through driving snow,
Unbowed by nature's fury, fierce and slow.

At last, the summit looms, a final test,
I crest the ridge, and there, a world at rest.
The valleys far below, a tapestry unfurled,
A sacred hush, this high, untrodden world.

I stand in silent wonder, humbled by the sight,
The earth below, a panoramic delight.
The clouds drift by, the sun's last golden ray,
Paints this cathedral, ere it fades away.

The descent awaits, but I will not forget,
This mountain's majesty, this triumph, hard-won yet.
For in this place, where heaven seems so near,
I've touched the divine, and found true peace, so clear.

So let this poem, this ode to nature's grace,
Inspire all who seek, this lofty, hallowed place.
To climb, to conquer, to bask in solitude,
Upon the summit, in nature's quiet mood.
